InSlim VML is a very basic and very barebones .dll splicing tool for modding
Unity packaged games. It's main use is when tied with Harmony 2.0 to make
drastic changes to game code. SlimVML is a branch redist of Unity Doorstop 3.0.
InSlimVML is specifically designed with Valheim, BepInEx, and Nexus Vortex in mind.
